# CSV -> IIF Converter
Hello, this is a fairly simple program and the actual input template accepted is hardcoded into the program itself, which 
I would redo if I had a reason to continue working on this project. It was canceled, but I was definitely onto something. 

##Unless you know how to code, this is pretty much useless to you, Oh well /shrug
Essentially, I was going to design it to accept a variety of different input layouts/templates, and then use the config/ folder to find matches in the description field, as this was to be used for accounting, and transferring bank statements from CSV to Quickbooks Importable IIF format.

Oh well, RIP Converter. I'm sure you can find another online.
